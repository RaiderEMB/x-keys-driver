  or the manpage listed below.

Compile: make
Install: make install

You may have to set 'PREFIX' to the location you want to install to. 
The default PREFIX is /usr/local

For packagers, there's also support for DESTDIR for staged install.

Also, see the manpage, which you can generate by running:
  make xdotool.1
  nroff -man xdotool.1 | less
Note, that the manpage will be installed during 'make install'
