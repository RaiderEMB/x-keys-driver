2.20100524.*:
  - Add --sync flag to many commands. This flag will make any supporting command
    block until the operation completes. For example, a 'windowmove --sync' will
    only exit once the window has moved. Commands supported:
    * windowactivate
    * windowfocus
    * windowmap
    * windowmove
    * windowunmap
  - Fix http://code.google.com/p/semicomplete/issues/detail?id=21
    Multiple keyboard layouts are now supported better. Added unit tests
    to ensure consistency in typing across releases.
  - Added polar coordinate support to mouse movement. 'mousemove' and
    'mousemove_relative' support this. Flag is --polar. 'x' becomes angle (degrees)
    and 'y' becomes distance. The default origin is screen center. If you specify
    a window (to mousemove) then the origin is the center of that window.
    Requested by Paul S on the xdotool-users mailing list.
  - internal: Reworked testing to be less flakey
    http://code.google.com/p/semicomplete/issues/detail?id=30
  - internal: split commands into one per C file
  - API changes that required a version bump.
    * xdo_keysequence and friends now take a delay.
  - New libxdo functions:
    * xdo_window_wait_for_map_state
    * xdo_window_wait_for_active
    * xdo_get_window_location
    * xdo_window_wait_for_focus


1.20100415.*:
  - Add support for searching classnames (not just class)
  - Support switched xkbmaps. We do this by checking if the keycode found for a keysym
    has that keysym as the first or second (normal or with shift-key) mapping, if not
    we pretend we didn't find it and request it be bound as if the keysym wasn't mapped
    to any key.

    This is a hack to avoid knowing what other modifiers are required to type
    keysyms mapped at indexes 2 or beyond (0 is normal, 1 is shift, 2 and beyond
    are unknown).
    Verified fixes this: http://code.google.com/p/semicomplete/issues/detail?id=13
    Should fix some of this: http://code.google.com/p/semicomplete/issues/detail?id=21
  - Add --shell flag to getmouselocation. This will output data you can safely
    eval in your shell.
  - Add platform detection for Darwin when building.
    Should fix: http://code.google.com/p/semicomplete/issues/detail?id=28

1.20100325.*:
  - Fix bug in search where --name wasn't working. Test written to cover this.
    http://code.google.com/p/semicomplete/issues/detail?id=25

1.20100318.*:
  - Bug fixes only this release
  - Rewrote tests to use ruby and will now test against Xvfb and Xephyr using:
    no window manager, openbox, and then gnome.
  - Fix build problems on Arch linux (or gentoo?)
    Fixes: http://code.google.com/p/semicomplete/issues/detail?id=20
  - Fix searching for only visible windows.
    Fixes: http://code.google.com/p/semicomplete/issues/detail?id=22
  - Fix xdotool search flags: --title, --name, --class
  - Add include for keysym.h to fix compile errors reported on the mailing
    list.

1.20100302.*:
  - Some test fixes suggested by Daniel Kahn Gillmor
  - Don't use isatty(0) anymore as it isn't totally reliable in determining if
    we should try to read from stdin.

1.20100301.*:
  - Minor libxdo patch to avoid exporting unnecessary symbols (Daniel Kahn
    Gillmor)
  - Minor Makefile fix to only link libxdo (and not xdotool) against libX11 and
    libXtst (also Daniel Kahn Gillmor)
  - Some test cleanup patches by Daniel Kahn Gillmor
  - Fixed the 'type hello' test that would fail sometimes when run in Xephyr. 
  - Fix a minor bug in xdo_window_setclass that incorrectly aborts when
    XGetClassHint fails.

1.20100227.*:
  - Bump major version since there were lots of libxdo changes (now
    libxdo.so.1)
  - Support '--pid NUM' for searching for windows by pid:
    Fixes http://code.google.com/p/semicomplete/issues/detail?id=10
    Example: xdotool search --pid 12345
    Example: xdotool search --pid 12345 "hello world"
  - Add 'xdotool getwindowpid' command to get the pid that owns a window.
  - Add --window to xdotool mousemove, click, mousedown, and mouseup
  - Add --screen to xdotool mousemove
  - The --clearmodifiers flag now clears mouse buttons, too.
    Part of http://code.google.com/p/semicomplete/issues/detail?id=6
  - The --clearmodifiers flag now clears caps lock.
    Fixes http://code.google.com/p/semicomplete/issues/detail?id=4
  - Have 'make install' create all required directories
    Fixes http://code.google.com/p/semicomplete/issues/detail?id=17
  - Support multiple screens in searches. Default is to search all screens.
    Fixes http://code.google.com/p/semicomplete/issues/detail?id=11
    Example: 'xdotool search --screen N' specifies a single screen to search.
  - Support reading a list of xdotool commands via stdin or a file. Usages:
    * read from stdin:
      xdotool -
    * read from stdin (use isatty(0) to detect redirection): 
      xdotool < somefile    
    * An executable script also works when it has this at the top:
      #!/path/to/xdotool

0.20100118.*:
  - Slight change in how we present versions. Now versions have major, date,
    and svn revision. The main addition was to add the major which maps to the
    libxdo library abi version (libxdo.so.0).
  - Add 'xdotool version' for querying version
  - libxdo now has xdo_version function for fetching the library version.
  - Allow typing keys that are not mapped to any keyboard button. 
    For example, you can type the euro symbol like this, even if you don't have
    a key on your keyboard that can do it:
      xdotool key EuroSign
    http://code.google.com/p/semicomplete/issues/detail?id=16
  - Fixed some pod errors in the manpage

20091231.03:
  - Fix regression in 'windowsize' command: --useflags stopped being accepted,
    now works again. Reported by Evangelos Foutras in bug/issue #15.

20091231.02:
  No functional changes.
  - fix linking problems and just use $(CC) for build and linking
  - Make the tests headless (requires Xvfb and GNOME)
  - Make the t/run.sh test runner exit-code friendly

20091231.01:
  No xdotool changes.
  libxdo changes:
    * Rename keysymcharmap -> keysym_charmap
    * Expose keysym_charmap and symbol_map as xdo_keysym_charmap() 
      and xdo_symbol_map()

20091210.01:
  * No functional changes.
  * Added a few patches from Russel Harmon which:
    + fix some memory leaks
    + add use of getopt in all the command functions
    + some makefile fixes
    + accept more variations of someone asking for help (-help and --help)

20091210:
  * No functional changes.
  * Added 'soname' (shared library name/version) to libxdo.so for better
    linkage. This change may break linking with non-gnu ld(1), I don't know.

20091208:
  * Added documentation about 'search --maxdepth' and new command 'set_window'
  * Added building of libxdo.so so other tools can link against it. This
    change requested by Debian:
      http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=560103

20090815:
  * Incorporate patch from Henning Bekel which adds a new ability to change
    window properties such as window name, icon name, class, role, etc.
    New command: xdotool set_window
  * Add --maxdepth to 'xdotool search' to limit the traversal depth

20090710:
  * You can clear keyboard modifiers during typing now with --clearmodifiers
    When used, this flag causes physical keyboard modifiers (alt, control, etc)
    that are currently active to be ignored during typing.
    This is supported in: xdotool key, keyup, keydown, and type.
    
    Example: 
      xdotool type 'hello world' results in 'HELLO WORLD' while holding shift.
      xdotool type --clearmodifiers 'hello world' results in 'hello world'
        regardless of you holding shift.

    The 'reset' only happens at the beginning of typing and the modifiers are
    restored at the end. If you press a modifier key *during* typing it will 
    act as if --clearmodifiers was not present.
    (http://code.google.com/p/semicomplete/issues/detail?id=6)

  * You can now specify literal keycodes for any key command.
    Example: xdotool key 38   (types 'a' with my keyboard)
    (requested via mailing list)

  * Regression fix: 'xdotool type' now properly obeys capitalization, again.
  * Bug fix: 'xdotool key --window' now works properly

20090612:
  * Fixed bug where shift modifier was not reset when 'xdotool type' used.
    http://code.google.com/p/semicomplete/issues/detail?id=5

20090609:
  * Add '--delay <delay_in_ms>' to xdotool type. Sets the delay between keys.
  * Add '--window <windowid>' to xdotool type, key, keyup, and keydown.
    This feature (key events with --window <windowid>) only works if the
    application does not reject X events that have 'send_event' set to true.

    Special notes:
    * Firefox appears to ignore all input when it does not have focus.
    * xterm ignores sendevent by default, ctrl+leftclick menu will let you
      enable it.
    * gnome-terminal appears to accept send_event input by default


20090330:
  * Fix bug where we use the wrong type in sizeof() for allocating character
    code map.
  * Fix tiny problem where we would try to free() an invalid pointer

20090126:
  * Change the default behavior of 'getwindowfocus' to get the first
    ancestor-or-self window that has WM_CLASS set. WM_CLASS will be set on
    (all?) top-level windows and it's possible that the currently focused
    window according to X is not a top-level window. To use the previous
    behavior, use 'getwindowfocus -f'
  * Make 'xdotool key at' work correctly. 'at' is usually Shift+2, for example.
    Now all shifted characters should work, but I've only tested on a US
    keyboard.
  * Minor Makefile fixes for package maintainers.

20080720:
  * Add 'getmouselocation' which ouputs the coordinate of the mouse cursor and
    the screen number the mouse is on.
  * Add 'getactivewindow' which uses NETWM to query the active window; this is
    often more reliable than 'getwindowfocus' assuming your window manager
    supports it
  * Fix typos in the documentationn.

20080716:
  * Fix return codes in xdo_keysequence() and other functions

20080606:
  * Correctly report an error if xdotool is invoked with an invalid command.
  * Fix invalid error code reporting from 'windowraise'

20080603:
  * Daniel Kahn Gillmor reported a problem with return codes from xdotool. All
    commands return proper exit status now (0 == success, nonzero == error)
  * I tested on 3 window managers: Gnome2 2.20.0, OpenBox 3.4, ion-3rc-20070608
    - Gnome and OpenBox pass all tests.
    - ion-3 fails on any desktop-related methods (ion-3 lacks the support).

20080601:
  * Add new commands:
    - windowactivate: Activate a window. If the window is on another desktop,
      we will switch to that desktop and then activate the window.
    - set_num_desktops number: Changes the number of desktops or workspaces.
    - get_num_desktops: Output the current number of desktops.
    - set_desktop desktop_number: Change the current view to the specified
        desktop.
    - get_desktop: Output the current desktop in view.
    - set_desktop_for_window window_id desktop_number: Move a window to a
        different desktop.
    - get_desktop_for_window window_id: Output the desktop currently containing
        the given window.

    windowactivate tested and confirmed working in: ion-3 and Gnome2 (metacity)
    The rest of the new commands have only been tested in Gnome2. They do not
    work in ion-3 due to lacking support for EWMH in ion.
  * Rewrote the man page in perlpod format.

20080521:
  * Import patches from keynav's xdotool branch (From Lukas Mai) which make
    xdotool compile happily when building with -Wall and -pedantic (and others)
  * Finally convert to using Window type for (hopefully) everything instead of
    incorrectly typecasting Window to int sometimes.
  * Confirmed that the one (but mostly useless) test passes.

20071230:
  * Manpage contribution by Daniel Kahn Gillmor
  * Add COPYRIGHT from svn to the distributed package.

20070903:
  * Add xdo_mousemove_relative for relative mouse movements
  * Add xdolib.sh. This is a script library to help with features xdo does not
    explicitly implement, such as querying window attributes, or fetching the
    root window id. An example which uses this is: examples/move_window_away.sh

20070812:
  * Magnus Boman contributed keysequence_{up,down} adding new commands to
    xdotool: keyup and keydown. These take the same arguments as 'key' but only
    send keyup or keydown events.
  * Lee Pumphret contributed getwindowfocus, which tells you the window id of
    the window currently holding focus.
  * Removed 'Makefile.no-pkg-config' because the original Makefile now knows
    how to build for both cases: with and without pkg-config.

20070722:
  * Compiles without warnings when using gcc -Wall now
  * Fixed false error reporting due to some functions missing return statements

20070713:
  * Add flag SIZE_USEHINTS to xdo_window_setsize
  * Add flag --usehints to xdotool windowsize

  Increments are used often in terminals that say "my font is 5 by 7 pixels, so
  resize by that increment". So, you can use this to set a terminal to be 80x24
  characters instead of pixels. Verified by resizing xterm and gnome-terminal
  (with menus enabled).

20070712:
  Added new search options to 'xdotool search'
    --onlyvisible shows only visible windows in the results
    --title causes only the window title to be matched
    --name causes the window name to be matched
    --class causes the window class to be matched

  For information on names and classes, check out the xprop tool.
    For example, for an xterm you will see this in the xprop output:
    WM_CLASS(STRING) = "xterm", "XTerm"
  "xterm" is the name, "XTerm" is the class. Don't ask me what the differences
  are supposed to be. ;)
